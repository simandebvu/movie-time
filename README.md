<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Usage

To have this app on your pc, you need to:
* have Ruby & Ruby on Rails installed in your computer
* [download](https://github.com/simandebvu/movie-time/development.zip) or clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
    git@github.com:simandebvu/movie-time.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS
  ```
    https://github.com/simandebvu/movie-time.git
  ```
* and open the terminal inside the repo and run the bundler
  - ```$ bundler install --without production```
* then, run rails db:migrate. This creates the database with the corresponding tables, columns and associations
  - ```$ rails db:migrate```
* then, run rails s. This will start the server at localhost `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
  - ```$ rails s```
* and finally, you can test it in the console by running
  - ```$ rails console --sandbox```
  
## IMPORTANT

** I used the Figaro gem to store credentials for use with POSTGRES. Therefore, we used SECRET KEYS stored in environment variables on our development and production servers.**

- So if you have postgres credentials create a file an application.yml file inside config/ and put this your credentials in it like showing bellow:

```ruby
DB_USERNAME: your_postgres_username
DB_PASSWORD: your_postgres_password
```

## Running tests

* Get into the folder with the application `movie-time` and open the terminal.
* Type in `rspec`. As soon as you press enter. Tests will start to run.
